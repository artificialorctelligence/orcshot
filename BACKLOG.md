# Backlog

Open items not yet scheduled into a task. Each entry keeps the context that
led to it - not just "what," but "why this matters" - so picking it up later
doesn't require re-deriving the reasoning from scratch.

## #178: Insert Window never uses the nicer Wayland Shell-native window-picker overlay

Found by a REQUIREMENTS.md sweep (2026-08-23, task #99's own original write-up), re-checked against current
code: `editor_window.py`'s `_do_insert_window` still passes `force_plain_overlay=True` to
`start_window_picker`. Understood, not mysterious - the Shell-native fast path (`window_picker.py`'s own
docstring) has no hook to hand a captured image back without routing it through the standard destination
picker (save/clipboard/edit/print/external-command), but Insert Window needs the raw image placed directly
into the *current* editor's own layer stack instead, a fundamentally different use case the Shell-native
path was never built to support.

Not a bug, a real architectural gap - revisit only if `GnomeShellWindowPicker` (or whatever backs the
Shell-native path) grows a way to hand back an image directly instead of always dispatching to a
destination.

## #179: "Reuse Editor" setting (task #111) - assigned a number, never built

Found by a REQUIREMENTS.md sweep (2026-08-23), re-checked against current code: `editor_window.py`'s
`_do_open` (task #129, File > Open) still says in its own docstring "task #111's 'Reuse Editor' setting
doesn't exist yet" - confirming the setting genuinely was never built, not just historically noted as
missing once. Every capture and every opened `.orcshot` file becomes its own new `EditorWindow`
unconditionally; there's no way to configure "open into the existing window instead."

Original context (task #93, 2026-08-10): "confirmed portable... but not built this round - left as an open
decision, not yet implemented, pending confirmation it's wanted." That confirmation never happened.
Whoever picks this up should start by asking direflail whether it's actually wanted at all before
implementing - task #93's own framing was explicitly conditional on that, not a settled "yes, build this."

## #167: VM clipboard doesn't carry images across the host/guest boundary

Surfaced live (direflail, 2026-08-22), same testing session as #166. Text
clipboard sharing between the Ubuntu 26.04 Wayland VM (guest) and the X11
host works correctly (VirtualBox Guest Additions bidirectional clipboard,
set up in an earlier session) - but capturing a screenshot in the VM via
Orcshot's "Copy to Clipboard" destination and trying to paste it out to the
host produces no output and no error at all.

Not yet root-caused. Most likely explanation, not confirmed: VirtualBox's
shared clipboard has a long-documented history of unreliable or entirely
absent support for non-text formats (images/pixmaps) between host and
guest, independent of anything the guest-side application does - this may
not be a real Orcshot bug at all, just a platform limitation of VirtualBox's
own shared-clipboard implementation. Needs investigation to confirm whether
this is fixable from Orcshot's side (e.g. a different clipboard target/MIME
type that VBox's shared clipboard *does* support) or is a hard platform
limitation worth just documenting as a known gap for VM-based Wayland
testing specifically - real Wayland hardware, or a non-VM Wayland session,
wouldn't hit this at all, so it may only ever matter for this project's own
dev-testing setup, not real users.

## #181: Crop-offset origin assumption unverified specifically for non-GNOME Wayland compositors

Narrowed successor to the old #175 (closed for GNOME - see REQUIREMENTS.md's Task #175 entry for the full
resolution). `capture/wayland.py`'s Wayland path reads monitor geometry through GDK's compositor-agnostic
enumeration (`gdk_screen_layout`), not a GNOME-specific API, so in principle a different Wayland compositor
(KWin, a wlroots-based one) could use a different coordinate convention for `bounds.left`/`bounds.top` than
Mutter's proven-always-non-negative guarantee. Not checked, and not urgent: orcshot's Wayland support is
built around a bundled GNOME Shell extension and isn't a supported target on other compositors anyway -
revisit only if that ever changes.


## #173: No i18n/translation infrastructure - every string is a hardcoded English literal

Scoping decision from task #93 (2026-08-10), recorded in REQUIREMENTS.md but never carried over into this
file (which didn't exist yet at the time) - resurfaced by direflail's own recollection, 2026-08-23.

Real Windows Greenshot ships 39 translations (`Greenshot/Languages/language-*.xml` - ar-SY, ca-CA, cs-CZ,
da-DK, de-DE, de-x-franconia, el-GR, en-US, es-ES, et-EE, fa-IR, fi-FI, fr-FR, fr-QC, he-IL, hu-HU, id-ID,
it-IT, ja-JP, kab-DZ, ko-KR, lt-LT, lv-LV, nl-NL, nn-NO, pl-PL, pt-BR, pt-PT, ro-RO, ru-RU, sk-SK, sl-SI,
sr-RS, sv-SE, tr-TR, uk-UA, vi-VN, zh-CN, zh-TW), each a `LanguageKey`-driven resource file (~304
`<resource>` entries in `language-en-US.xml` alone). Orcshot has zero i18n infrastructure - every
user-facing string across the whole `ui/` tree is a hardcoded English literal in the Python source, not a
lookup against any resource table.

Not attempted as part of task #93 or since - explicitly scoped out at the time as "not a Preferences-
dialog checkbox; it's a foundational rework (extract ~300+ literals into a resource/gettext layer, wire
every widget construction site to look them up, then translate and maintain N language files) that
touches nearly every file under `ui/`." That characterization still holds; nothing about the size or shape
of the effort has changed since. Likely direction, if picked up: standard Python `gettext`
(`.po`/`.mo` files, `_()` wrapping at each call site) rather than inventing a bespoke resource-table format
the way the real Windows app's own XML scheme does - `gettext` is the established Linux/GTK convention and
would compose naturally with `debian/rules`' existing packaging rather than needing new build tooling.
Scope alone (300+ literals, every `ui/` file, N language files to actually translate and maintain) makes
this a dedicated effort of its own, not something to fold into an unrelated task.
